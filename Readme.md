# Food-Images-Classification
In this project, worked on 3-layer CNN, 5-layer CNN, vgg16, inception models and ResNet models. Training all the models by using Food11 dataset on Kaggle then predicting the food images from the test data given in Food11 dataset then finding the accuracy of each model. After this randomly picking some images and evaluating the model.

As compared to all the models, the inception model is giving the highest accuracy.
